Today marks the first day of a week-long celebration called [`#BlackinDataWeek`](https://blkindata.github.io/). It is a weeke to amplify Black voices in `#informatics`, `#datascience`, & `#coding` around the world. The goals are to:

1. Provide community and a support system for Black people in data across the Black diaspora.

1. Encourage growth in our professional and academic learning paths.

1. Elevate the voices and experiences of Black people working in data fields.

## How to engage in `#BlackInDataWeek`


### Day 1: `#BlackInDataRollCall`

- If you identify as Black, TODAY join in the roll call by introducing yourself and sharing what you do in data. Include the hashtag [`#BlackInDataRollCall`](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInDataRollCall) and tag [`@BlkInData`](https://twitter.com/BlkInData).

- If you do not, use today to amplify the voices in the [`#BlackInDataRollCall`](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackInDataRollCall) hashtag. Follow + retweet! 

- If you haven't already, follow the [`@WeAreRLadies`](https://twitter.com/WeAreRLadies) rotating curator account. This week, [Markia Smith](https://blkindata.github.io/author/markia-smith/) will take over (Nov 16-20th) and [Damilola](https://twitter.com/thedamialex) will be taking over next week (Nov 23-27).

### Day 2: `#BlackInDataJourney`

There are three events on this day, check them out [here](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindatajourney/). Note that there will not a [`#TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-17/readme.md) this week in order to create space and engage with the `#BlackInDataViz` hashtag on Twitter.

### Day 3: `#BlackInDataSkills`

A great day filled with [learning-oriented events](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindataskills/), and don't miss the 1-hour [Introduction to R](https://blkindata.github.io/talk/intro2r2020/) with [Dr. A Nayena Blankson](https://twitter.com/DrBlankson).

### Day 4: `#BlackInDataViz`

Again, several great [events and talks](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindataviz/), as well as a [Black In Data Visualisation Challenge](https://blkindata.github.io/talk/datavizdaycomp2020/). The challenge, presented in collaboration with the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/), will "highlight data that shows Black people in a positive light."

### Day 5: `#BlackInDataJustice`

[Webinars](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindatajustice/) feature timely topics around algorithmic fairness and bias. The [last event](https://blkindata.github.io/talk/codedbias-2020/) is a live viewing/tweeting of [`#CodedBias`](https://www.saltlakefilmsociety.org/comingsoon/coded-bias) in honour of #BlackinDataJustice hosted by Anna Gifty, [`@itsafronomics`](https://twitter.com/itsafronomics), an emerging researcher interested in data bias and algorithmic fairness.

You can access the screening here: https://www.saltlakefilmsociety.org/comingsoon/coded-bias

*(note: tickets are not free, but you can follow along with the live tweeting without watching)*

### Day 6: `#BlackInDataMentorship`

The final day, Saturday, is all about careers and mentorship, read more about the events [here](https://blkindata.github.io/project/blackindatacommunity/).
